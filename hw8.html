Part 1:

Recreate the 'gethint' Ajax example from W3Schools (Links to an external site.). Use the php file containing the hints and expand them to include several more names as hints (at least 10 more names).

Do some research and include in that page a paragraph presenting a REST API that you could use in an application and the URL to the documentation of that API - it cannot be any Github API, neither BART as both of those two have been mentioned in the lecture! You can start your research here - https://apilist.fun/ (Links to an external site.) - your paragraph or table should contain at least the following information: What type of response file you get (JSON, XML, etc.)? Do you need any type of key to access and use the API? You need also to provide a link to any type of documentation that would help the developer use the API.

Note: It is recommended to upload your php script (file) to the web hosting server, into the same directory where your HTML file resides. Be sure to give your php directory read and execute permissions (chmod 700 or 755 php). Remember that you can use the setup script, after login in Hills (using Terminal in Mac or using PuTTY in Windows), and the script will set up automatically the right permissions to any files and folders from the public_html down in case you get the FORBIDDEN message to the .php program you will upload.

ATTENTION!!!

    You will need to use a web server that supports PHP - the Github as a web server WILL NOT WORK!!!
    Remember that you will need to upload the php file to the Hills server (or the web server you are using that needs to support PHP)!

To submit your homework:

1. Once you upload your Homework 8 pages to the Hills server, make sure you can view the pages in a web browser.
2. Make sure you update the link of your Homework 1 page that refers to the Homework 8 and then you should highlight the URL of your main CNIT 133 page (Homework 1), copy it and paste in the box provided to submit your work
3. Click the "Submit assignment" button to submit your assignment.

I should be able to open your Homework 1 page, click on Homework 8 link and see the main page of your Homework 8 with links to the parts requested - as this Homework has only one part, you can present the solution on the Homework 8 page. -->
